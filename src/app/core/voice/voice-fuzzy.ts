/**
 * Repairs near-miss clinical terms so the deterministic grammar gets a chance
 * to match them.
 *
 * ── The problem this solves ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The grammar is regex, and regex is exact. A dentist says "upper right first
 * molar recurrence caries", the recogniser hears it faithfully, and
 * `/\bcarie\s+r[ée]currente/` and its English twin both decline — because the
 * word was "recurrence", not "recurrent". The command is lost, and to the
 * dentist it looks as though the system simply did not hear them.
 *
 * Widening the patterns is not the answer: they would have to anticipate every
 * inflection and mishearing in three languages, and every widening makes some
 * other finding easier to match by accident. Sending every miss to an LLM is
 * not the answer either — it works, but it costs a network round trip on an
 * utterance that was 95% right, and the dentist waits.
 *
 * So this sits between the two. It corrects individual words against the
 * vocabulary the lexicon already contains, in about a millisecond, and hands
 * the repaired sentence back to the same grammar. What it cannot repair still
 * falls through to the LLM.
 *
 * ── What it will not touch ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Numbers. Never. "Seize" is one edit from "sept" and two from "treize", and
 * a fuzzy match there moves a finding to a different tooth — which is the one
 * error class that survives review, because the resulting record reads as
 * entirely ordinary. Digits, number words in all three languages, and any
 * token containing a digit are excluded before matching, and the threshold is
 * set high enough that ordinary words are not rewritten either.
 */

/**
 * Jaro-Winkler similarity below which two words are treated as unrelated.
 *
 * Jaro-Winkler rather than plain edit distance because mishearings and
 * inflections overwhelmingly preserve the start of a word — "recurrence" for
 * "recurrent", "caries" for "carie" — while genuinely different clinical
 * terms tend to diverge early. Normalised Levenshtein scores
 * "recurrence"/"recurrent" at 0.80, below any threshold that is also safe,
 * which is precisely the repair this module exists to make.
 *
 * 0.92 was chosen against the real lexicon:
 *
 *     recurrence → recurrent    0.938   accepted
 *     caries     → carie        0.967   accepted
 *     obturation → obturations  0.982   accepted
 *     gingivale  → gingivite    0.911   REJECTED
 *     seize      → treize       0.822   rejected
 *     carie      → couronne     0.693   rejected
 *
 * The gingivale/gingivite pair is why it sits at 0.92 and not lower: gingival
 * recession and gingivitis are different findings, and the right behaviour
 * when the system cannot tell which was said is to decline and let the
 * utterance fall through to the LLM — not to pick one.
