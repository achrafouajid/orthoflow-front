/**
 * Billing types.
 *
 * The wire types are re-exported from `core/api/contract` rather than declared
 * here. The hand-written versions they replace had drifted from the server in a
 * way that showed up as a bug rather than a compile error: `Invoice` declared
 * `patientName`, `treatmentPlanId`, `insuranceScheme`, `notes` and `updatedAt`,
 * none of which `InvoiceResponse` has ever contained. The invoice list rendered
 * `patientName` in its patient column (always blank) and searched on it
 * (never matching). See `core/api/contract.ts` for why the duplication existed.
 *
 * `Quote` and `InsuranceClaim` stay hand-written below because they are not
 * wire types at all — there is no quote or claim endpoint. They are kept, and
 * labelled, so that the distinction between "contract" and "not built yet"
 * is visible in the type system rather than discovered at runtime.

 * This is deliberately built on `InvoiceLineRequest`, not on the response
 * type. The two differ: the request carries `discountPct` and `sortOrder`,
 * the response carries `id` and `lineTotal`. The composer previously typed
 * its draft lines as the response type, which is how it came to omit
 * `actCode` — a `@NotBlank` field on the server — and how the omission went
 * unnoticed. `lineTotal` is added back because the composer shows a running
 * per-line total; the server recomputes it and ignores whatever is sent.

// nothing validates them against the backend because there is nothing to
// validate against. Move them into `core/api/contract.ts` on the day the
// backend grows `/quotes`, and delete them from here.
